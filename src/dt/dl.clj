  Databases like Datomic are made
  of an accumulation of facts of the
  form

  [entity attribute value]

  e.g.

  [:birds :have :wings]

  or

  [:horses :eat :carrots]

  A Datalog query is a list
  of clauses where a clause is
  a desired fact, something we want
  to be true of the results:

  [?animal :eats :carrots]

  symbols prefixed with ? are
  called variables, and they're
  what the query could return as results.
  The query engine will find entities
  that can be substituted for the ?variables,
  making the clauses true

  A query returns results for which
  *all* the clauses we list are true

  [[?animal :eats :carrots]
   [?animal :has :wings]]

  this query has two clauses and will
  return all entities which we're calling
  ?animal here but it could be anything

  [[?x :eats :carrots]
   [?x :has :wings]]

  here's one with more variables

  [[?animal ?something :carrots]
   [?animal :has :wings]]

  this vector (or list) of clauses
  is logical AND - it's like
  (and clause0 clause1 clause2...)

  the process of ensuring all clauses
  are true by making sure all
  their ?variables refer to the same
  entities is called 'unification'

  In the example above, we want entities
  ?animal which both :eats :carrots and
  :has :wings

  Entities are stored as numbers
  in the database


  -------- footnotes --------

  Variables are just symbols -
  the ? prefix is to identify them as variables
  to the query engine

  Evaluate the test-query-x functions,
  modify them and see what happens
